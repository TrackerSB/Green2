# Green2
A client for creating serial letters and Sepa Direct Debits. The main audience of this project are associations.

## Main audience
* People working voluntary for associations

## Overall goals
1. Very easy to use (People working voluntary for associations might not be very experienced with computers)
2. Exactly matched to the needs of the people which are using it
3. Security of the sensitive data (This tool is using a database which may be located in some network)

## Why?
The reason for introducing such a client is providing a simple tool making it for people working voluntary for associations easier to do their daily job. They want to generate Sepa Direct Debits for contributions and other stuff, addresses of member (very useful for serial letters), and lists (and also addresses) of people having a certain configureable birthdays in a certain year.

## What´s next?
The next step what´s done next, which feature is added or whatever is in first instance depending on the people using it. They just say something like "Wouldn´t it be great if..." And that´s the next goal!

## Current goals
Currently people are happy about the features already included so some other improvments to the crrent features are made.
