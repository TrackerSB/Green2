# Green2
A client for creating serial letters, Sepa Direct Debits, etc.

## Main audience
* People working voluntary for associations

## Overall goals
1. Very easy to use (People working voluntary for associations might not be very experienced with computers)
2. Exactly matched to the needs of the people which are using it
3. Security of the sensitive data (This tool is using a database which may be located in some network)

## Considered goals
* English language support (Since all people currently using Green2 are speaking german, there´s no need to support english as well. Nevertheless a big part of the application is already available in english)

For considered goals search the issues for "considered" label.

## Why?
The reason for introducing such a client is providing a simple tool making it for people working voluntary for associations easier to do their daily job. They want to generate Sepa Direct Debits for contributions and other stuff, addresses of member (very useful for serial letters), and lists (and also addresses) of people having a certain configureable birthdays in a certain year.

## What´s next?
The next step what´s done next, which feature is added or whatever is in first instance depending on the people using it. They just say something like "Wouldn´t it be great if..." And that´s the next goal!

## Current goals
Currently people seem to be happy about the features already included so some other improvments to the current features are made.

## Coding conventions
The coding conventions are exactly Java coding conventions [(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf) but the recommended maximum line length mentioned in section 4.1 is extended to 120 characters.
